    <dt><em>Zion National Park</em></dt>
    <dd><strong>Q: Where can I ride my bike in Zion National Park?</strong><br>
        A: The best place is on the Pa'rus Trail and the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive (when the Zion Canyon Shuttle is
        operating). All cyclists are required to ride on the Pa'rus Trail from the South Entrance to Canyon Junction.</dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><em>Black Canyon Of The Gunnison</em></dt>
    <dd><strong>Q: How do I get to the other side of the canyon?</strong><br>
        A: There is no bridge between the South and North Rims. Allow two to three hours to drive from one side to the
        other.</dd>
    <br><br>
    <dt><em>Mormon Pioneer</em></dt>
    <dd><strong>Q: What year was the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail established?</strong> <br>
        A: Congress established the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail in 1978. The trail commemorates the 1846-47
        journeys of the Mormon people led by Brigham Young, the second leader of the Mormon Church. Use of the trail lasted for many years, but the official trail covers only the history and locations from the first Mormon company. The first party led by Brigham Young completed the trip in two segments from February 4, 1846 to July 24, 1847.</dd>
<br><br>
<dt><em>Death Valley</em></dt>
<dd><strong>Q: Why is it called Death Valley?</strong><br>
    A: Death Valley was given its forbidding name by a group of pioneers lost here in the winter of 1849-1850. Even
        though, as far as we know, only one of the group died here, they all assumed that this valley would be their
        grave. They were rescued by two of their young men, William Lewis Manly and John Rogers, who had learned to be scouts. As the party climbed out of the valley over the Panamint Mountains, one of the men turned, looked back, and said "goodbye, Death Valley." This name, and the story of The Lost '49ers have become part of our western history.</dd>
<br><br>
<dt><em>Buffalo</em></dt>
<dd><strong>Q: Can you hike along the Buffalo National River?</strong><br>
    A: Yes. There are over 100 miles (160 km) of maintained trails within the park. Some trails will accommodate hiker
    and horse use. However, some trails are designed for foot traffic only and are marked with a white blaze. Trails blazed in yellow are hiker/horseback trails. Bicycles are not permitted on any park trails and pets are permitted on only two trails in the park.</dd>
<br><br>
<dt><em>Fort Smith</em></dt>
<dd><strong>Q: What is the acreage of the park?</strong><br>
    A: Fort Smith National Historic Site is authorized 75 acres, but the current park size is 37 acres.
</dd>
<br><br>
<dt><em>Aztec Ruins</em></dt>
<dd><strong>Q: Why are they called “Aztec” Ruins? Weren’t the Aztecs in Mexico?</strong><br>
    A: The name is a misnomer. Popular and scholarly opinion in the nineteenth century held that the ancestors of the Aztecs migrated southward into Mexico from the U.S. Southwest. As a result, Euro-American explorers at the time often gave ancient ruins names such as “Aztec,” “Montezuma,” or “Toltec.”</dd>
<br><br>
<dt><em>Tallgrass Prairie</em></dt>
<dd><strong>Q: Where is all the tall grass?</strong><br>
    A: It is a common misconception that one will see an entire prairie of six feet tall grasses blowing in the wind at any time of the year. In the spring the grasses will not have reached their full height; they are just beginning to grow. It takes nature an entire season to grow the prairie grasses. Think of "tall in the fall". The tallest grasses grow in the bottomland areas where water is more readily available and the soils are deeper. The grasses on the prairie uplands will generally grow between three and five feet high.</dd>
<br><br>
<dt><em>Appomattox Court House</em></dt>
<dd><strong>Q: Where's the courthouse, where the surrender took place?</strong><br>
    A: The surrender occurred in the village of Appomattox Court House, Virginia in a private home owned by the McLean
    family. In Virginia many of the towns which were county seats were called "Court House". The building is spelled courthouse (one word) and the town is Court House (two words).</dd>
<br><br>
<dt><em>Death Valley</em></dt>
<dd><strong>Q: Why is it called Death Valley?</strong><br>

    grave. They were rescued by two of their young men, William Lewis Manly and John Rogers, who had learned to be scouts.

    <h3>Arches</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>This site features more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches, with some of the most popular arches in the park being Delicate Arch, Landscape Arch and Double Arch.</li>
    <li>Millions of years of erosion have created these structures located in a desert climate where the arid ground has life-sustaining biological soil crusts and potholes that serve as natural water-collecting basins.</li>
    <li>The park consists of 76,679 acres of high desert located on the Colorado Plateau.</li>
    <li>The area was originally named a national monument on April 12, 1929, and was redesignated as a national park
        on November 12, 1971.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Big Bend</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Named for the prominent bend in the Rio Grande along the U.S.–Mexico border, this park encompasses a large and remote part of the Chihuahuan Desert.</li>
    <li>The park has national significance as the largest protected area of Chihuahuan Desert topography and ecology in the United States. </li>
    <li>The park protects more than 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, 56 species of reptiles, and 75 species of mammals.[3]</li>
    <li>The area has a rich cultural history, from archeological sites dating back nearly 10,000 years to more recent pioneers, ranchers, and miners.[4]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Canyonlands National Park</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Canyonlands National Park is an American national park located in southeastern Utah near the town of Moab.</li>
    <li>The park preserves a colorful landscape eroded into numerous canyons, mesas, and buttes by the Colorado River, the Green River, and their respective tributaries. </li>
    <li>The park is divided into four districts: the Island in the Sky, the Needles, the Maze, and the combined
        rivers—the Green and Colorado—which carved two large canyons into the Colorado Plateau.</li>
    <li>In September 1964, after several years of debate, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Pub.L. 88–590, which established Canyonlands National Park as a new national park. </li>
</ul>
